🌱 My skillset includes Git, C#, .NET,
Relational Databases & SQL, HTTP & Web API Basics,
Unit Testing, Test Driven Development, HTML & CSS, Angular CLI

👨‍💻 Currently creating new projects - developing driving school managment system and flight planner-application which can store flights between different airports and allows to search them.
