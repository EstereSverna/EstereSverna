</span>

As a software developer, I firmly believe that passion is the fuel that propels us forward. For me, this passion lies at the intersection of coding and the captivating world of mathematics. I'm always **eager to tackle new challenges**, refine my skills, and expand my knowledge.

**My technical toolkit includes:**
- **Languages**: C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, T-SQL, Python (basics)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: .NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, React, Knockout.js, ABP Framework
- **Databases**: Microsoft SQL Server, ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL
- **DevOps & Tools**: Docker, RabbitMQ, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Git, Postman
- **Testing**: xUnit, SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
- **Data Integration & ETL**: SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies, driven by an **insatiable curiosity** to understand the intricate workings of the systems I build. My journey in software development is guided by a **commitment to continuous improvement** and innovation.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading literature, experimenting with recipes, dancing ballet, or enjoying the great outdoors. I believe that the **problem-solving skills** and principles I've developed through my love of mathematics are invaluable assets not only in my software development but also in my personal journey. Whether it’s improvising in the kitchen, designing new table layouts, analyzing the best ballet stretches, or tackling a mysterious bug, I find excitement and joy in every challenge.

If you’re looking for a **passionate, dedicated, and curious software developer** who thrives on tackling complex problems, let’s connect! I’d be thrilled to discuss how I can contribute to your next project.

Let's code, calculate, and **create something amazing** together!
